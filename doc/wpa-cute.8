.SH NAME
wpaCute \- A graphical wpa_supplicant front end
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBwpa-cute\fR [ \fB-i \fIifname\fB\fR ] [ \fB-m \fIseconds\fB\fR ] [ \fB-N\fR ] [ \fB-P\fR ] [ \fB-p \fIpath-to-ctrl-sockets\fB\fR ] [ \fB-q\fR ] [ \fB-t\fR ]

.SH "OVERVIEW"
.PP
wpaCute is a graphical Qt front end program for interacting
with wpa_supplicant. It's used to query current status, change
configuration and request interactive user input.
.PP
It supports (almost) all of the interactive status and
configuration features of the command line client, wpa_cli. Refer
to the wpa_cli man page for a comprehensive list of the interactive
mode features.
.PP
wpaCute is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant
version 2.6
.SH "COMMAND ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB-i ifname\fR
Specify the interface that is being
configured. By default, choose the first interface found with
a control socket in the socket path.
.TP
\fB-m seconds\fR
Set an independent update interval in seconds for the signal
strength meter. This value must be a positive integer.
Without \fB-m\fR the signal meter is only updated at each status update.
See also \fB-P\fR and the notes about polling and pinging  
.TP
\fB-N\fR
Force not to use QSocketNotifier, use polling instead so it
implies \fB-P\fR\&. It's more for testing purposes.
.TP
\fB-p path\fR
Change the path where control sockets should
be found.
.TP
\fB-P\fR
Enable polling and pinging wpa_supplicant independent to the
use of QSocketNotifier.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Run program in the quiet mode - do not display tray
icon pop-up messages.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Start program in the system tray only (if the window
manager supports it). By default the main status window is
shown.
.SH "POLLING AND PINGING"
.PP
QSocketNotifier is not supported on all systems but used by
default. On such systems is wpa_supplicant polled and pinged to fetch
status changes.
.PP
The polling is not done in a fixed interval but depends on
current status and reach from high frequent polling in 1sec, when
probably changes are on the way, down to 30sec in normal connected
mode where only is checked if all looks good.
.PP
Disconnect the adapter disables polling completely.
When in inactive or scanning status is polled in 9sec.
With the main window visible is polled in 2sec.
