>Overview</H2
><P
>wpaCute is a graphical Qt front end program for interacting
    with wpa_supplicant. It's used to query current status, change
    configuration and request interactive user input.</P
><P
>It supports (almost) all of the interactive status and
    configuration features of the command line client, wpa_cli. Refer
    to the wpa_cli man page for a comprehensive list of the interactive
    mode features.</P
><P
>wpaCute is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant
    version 2.6</P

>Polling And Pinging</H3
><P
>QSocketNotifier is not supported on all systems but used by
  default. On such systems is wpa_supplicant polled and pinged to fetch
  status changes.
  </P
><P
>The polling is not done in a fixed interval but depends on
  current status and reach from high frequent polling in 1sec, when
  probably changes are on the way, down to 20sec in normal Connected
  mode where only is checked if all looks good.
  </P
><P
>With the main window visible is polled in 2.5sec.
  When in Inactive or Scanning status is polled in 9sec.
  Will the adapter disconnected is still polled in 20sec.
  In case of an fatal error is polling halted.

>Edit Network</H3
><P
>The window morphs its look to show always only what is needed, or can be
  used, to some selections you made. If you encounter some misbehaviour please
  report.
  </P
><P
>Entered secrets will not shown again when you edit a network. Only a
  hint that there is a password or key saved. I'm not a friend of that because
  while messing around to get a connect you can't check if you miss typed the
  password or something different is the problem.
  </P
><P
>When you add, delete or modify a network are these changes only made in
  a temporary manner inside the running wpa_supplicant. They take effect as long
  as the wpa_supplicant is not terminated or triggered to reload its
  configuration. You have to save the changes explicit. This is different from
  the original wpa_gui.
  </P
><P
>Right now is the behaviour, which data are changed (send to
  wpa_supplicant) not coherend. It depends sometimes if they are visible when
  you "Apply" or not. Your removed data are not everytime forced to remove by
  wpa_supplicant. It's a little messi, sorry. Needs love and reports.
  </P
><P
>Right now will no data explicit removed when they are not visible. The
  wpa_supplicant documentation describes that you can have a pretty mix of
  possible settings which are all tested when wpa_supplicant tries to connect
  to some accesspoint. I'm not sure if this is really a smart decison.
  </P
><P
>Long story, short sense: Don't expect to have a "clean" configured
  network block in your config file after you have clicked around to find a
  working setup.

>While transforming some code from old-school C/C++ to a more Qt like
  style, I noticed some wpa control request that are not, or in a different way,
  supported by wpa_cli. So you may encounter some disappointments. I haven't
  played much with the peers window.
