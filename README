wpaCute
=========

This is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant version 2.6, which
has a couple of issues I have fixed in this new derivative. I did not have tried
to send my patches upstream because of their terms and my paranoia.

I started using wpa_gui when I was looking for a tray icon for my systemd-only
network setup on my new laptop and realised as soon that there was not all
roses. Beginning from wrong/missing icons to the actual wlan status, over
baffling buttons, windows and menus up to a smashed, no longer working
configuration after an save event, with obviously no changes mind you!


Installation
==============

Required is now at least Qt 5.3 due to use of QSignalBlocker.


From Source
-------------

  $ cd src
  $ qmake-qt5
